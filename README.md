# bus-mall

as I devloper for this websit I created it using Javascript,HTML and CSS.
this project called Bus-mall is similar to the SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes: a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. The difference with BusMall is that instead of their catalog being placed in airplanes, they are placed on local busses while commuting through traffic.

- I created the first step.
the websit provide 3 images in home page then the user can select on of them.
- snd step design the websit by using CSS proprties.

  The appâ€™s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

  Rahaf Albakkar.
